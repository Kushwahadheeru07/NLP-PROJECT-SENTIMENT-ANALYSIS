# NLP-PROJECT-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-using google collab


üìö Introduction
This project demonstrates Sentiment Analysis, a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), using a Google Colab notebook. It enables users to classify text into categories such as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The project is designed for ease of use, leveraging Colab‚Äôs cloud environment to run experiments without needing a local setup.


üßπ Data Cleaning Techniques

The following preprocessing steps are implemented to prepare the data for sentiment analysis:

Text Normalization: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling special characters.

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual tokens or words.

Stopword Removal: Eliminating words like "is," "the," and "and" that add little semantic value.

Stemming & Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base forms (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").

Noise Removal: Removing URLs, hashtags, and irrelevant characters.


üíª Implementation on Google Colab

Features:
Cloud-based environment: No need for installation or local configuration.

Interactive code: Use the notebook for hands-on experimentation.

Integration with popular libraries: Includes libraries such as nltk, sklearn, transformers, and matplotlib for a comprehensive NLP pipeline.

üß† Machine Learning Workflow

Workflow Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text data for modeling.

Feature Extraction:

TF-IDF for traditional models.

Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) for deep learning models.

Model Selection:

Logistic Regression or Na√Øve Bayes for baseline models.

Fine-tuned Transformer models like BERT for enhanced accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: Measure performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
